# Interview Prep for Reynolds and Reynolds (Auto Data Direct)
Notes I am taking while preparing for an upcoming cyber security interview. All notes are stored in Markdown and can be found in their respective folders.

Topics mostly catered to an Analyst role, but I also have an interest in Security Engineering, so the notes can be a bit robust at times to reflect that.

# Live Website 
A live version of these can be found on my website, as well as my various other notes on differing topics. The website version is updated more frequently due to a CICD pipeline integrated with my note taker.
