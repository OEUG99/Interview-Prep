# Interview-Prep
Notes I am taking while preparing for a cyber security interview.  All notes are stored in Markdown and can be found in their respective folders. 

# Live Website 
A live version of these can be found on my website, as well as my various other notes on differing topics. The website version is updated more frequently due to a CICD pipeline integrated with my note taker.
